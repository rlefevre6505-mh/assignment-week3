For this assignment I achieved all the standard requiredments, and ............ as stretch goals.

I struggled with a few specific aspects of this assignment, despite managing previous assignments quite easily. Firstly, after creating an asunc function to fetch API upgrade data, understanding how tocreate a second async function in which to include the loop for creating upgrade buttons and add event listeners to them. Secondly, getting the game data to store and retreiev properly. Working through these ws a real struggle, even with some guidance from Bertie and Sam, although their help was invaluable! I think the issue with both of these areas was that my understanding of these specific processes and how they can/cannot work was limited, although this has helped me understand them better. Some of the ways I needed to use local storage and API data were outside of what was covered in our workshop, so needed a bit of a deeper understanding, which took a while for me to get, as most of my online research was less halpful than it has been in previous situations, partly due to change of syntax from common JS to ES6.

When starting the assignment, I took phone-first approach to the layout

I decided I wanted the player to have a basic game guide and to have some cosmetic control, so I added a button at the bottom of the screen that creates a new div, covering the game temporarily, in which they can read to understand the concept, choose to have coloured text or white text only, and then exit the pop-up.
I also considered adding the option for a cleaner font, but did not implement this due to time constraints, although this is definitely somethign I would do for accessibiity purposes.
